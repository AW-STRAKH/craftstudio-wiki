# Model export

(Note that exporting requires the full version of CraftStudio.)

You can export static models in [the OBJ file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file) from CraftStudio by typing `/export obj` in the model editor's chat. To export the texture as PNG, type `/export texture`.

CraftStudio also has a custom JSON-based model and animation format that's easy to read in a text editor and can be used as an intermediary format to convert to other engines.

To export a JSON model, type `/export json model`. To export the currently active animation, type `/export json animation`.
